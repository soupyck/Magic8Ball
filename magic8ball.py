# I'm sure you've used a magic 8 ball at one point in your life. You ask it a question, turn it right side up
# and it gives an answer by way of a floating die with responses written on it. You can create one in python. You must:
# Allow the user to enter their question
# Display an in progress message( i.e. "thinking")
# Create 20 responses, and show a random response
# Allow the user to ask another question or quit
# Bonus Using whatever module you like, add a gui. Your gui must have:
# A box for users to enter the question
# At least 4 buttons: Ask , clear(the text box), play again and quit(this must close the window)
